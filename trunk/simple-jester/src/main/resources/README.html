- the test tester.</H1>
<P><TT>Copyright (2000-2008) <A HREF="http://www.tadmad.co.uk/">Ivan
Moore</A>.</TT> 
</P>
<P>Jester finds code that is not covered by tests. Jester makes some
change to your code, runs your build (which runs your tests), and if
the tests pass Jester displays a message saying what it changed.
(This is called &quot;mutation testing&quot;). This version of Jester
is a simplification of the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; one. The aim for
this version of Jester is for it to be much simpler to run.</P>
<P>Jester includes a script for generating web pages that show the
changes made that did not cause the tests to fail. 
</P>
<P>Jester is different than code coverage tools, because it can find
code that is executed by the running of tests but not actually
tested. However, Jester is not meant as a replacement for code
coverage tools, merely as a complementary approach. 
</P>
<P>Jester is available only under the terms of the <A HREF="LICENSE.html">license
agreement</A>. 
</P>
<P>This version of Jester has been tried on Windows, using Sun's JDK
1.5. There is absolutely no warranty whatsoever (see <A HREF="LICENSE.html">license
agreement</A> ); it might work on those or other platforms - see the
<A HREF="http://jester.sourceforge.net/">Jester web page</A> for
latest known bugs, platforms that it has been tried on, FAQs, etc).
Older versions of Jester might work with older versions of Java.</P>
<P>The <FONT COLOR="#008000">most important bits are in green</FONT>, for the impatient.</P>
<H2>Installation:</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">unzip the jester.zip file (e.g.
	simple-jester-1.0.zip) in an empty directory 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Java (&gt;=1.4) must already be
	installed, with java on the path 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For a simple
	example (which currently only runs under Windows), run the batch
	file '<TT>test.bat</TT>'. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Some text should be output, and after less than 2 minutes,
	the execution should finish with following text output: 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><TT>17 mutations survived out of 19 changes. Score = 11</TT><BR><TT>took
0 minutes</TT> 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the message above does not
	appear, see the FAQ referenced at the end of this document. 
	</P>
	<P>This example also needs <B>Python &gt;= 2.0</B> installed and
	generates a file &quot;<TT>jester.html</TT>&quot; which shows the
	changes Jester made that did not cause the tests to fail. (If you
	don't have python installed, then '<TT>test.bat</TT>' will still run
	but won't produce &quot;<TT>jester.html</TT>&quot; and will say
	something about python not being recognized. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Jester has a progress window - the progress bar shows the
proportion of source files that have been mutated; the text area
shows the most recent mutation that has been made; the progress bar
is green if the last mutation caused the tests to fail (i.e. good)
and red if the tests still passed despite the mutation (i.e. bad).
Note that the progress bar does not show progress while making
different mutations to the same file - that is shown by text in the
text area changing - because that was simpler to implement.

	<LI><P><STRONG><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Very IMPORTANT</FONT></B></STRONG><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">
	- only run Jester on a copy of your source files</FONT></B> - as
	Jester changes the source code that it works on. If you use source
	control (which everyone should!) then you can leave your source code
	where it is (making sure everything you want to be in source control
	is checked in) and overwrite all your source from source control
	after running Jester. If you don't use source control, only run
	Jester on a copy of your source in a different directory, otherwise

	not just &quot;ant&quot;. NOTE that you need the double quotes

	will).</FONT></P>
	<LI><P>For any change that Jester was able to make without the build
	failing, it prints the name of the file changed, the position in the
	file of the change (the character index), and some of the original
	source file from roughly 30 characters before to 30 characters after
	so that the change can be identified within the source file. Note
	that Jester can take a long time to run - try it on a small part of
	your system before trying it on everything.</P>
	<LI><P>Jester also produces a file called &quot;<TT>jesterReport.xml</TT>&quot;
	that contains all the changes that Jester made that did not cause
	the tests to fail.

		</P>
	<LI><P>Execute &quot;<TT>python makeAllChangesFiles.py
	jesterReport.xml</TT>&quot; to generate copies of the original
	source files with all the changes Jester made that did not cause the
	tests to fail. These files are in the same directories, and have the
	same names, exept have a &quot;<TT>.jester</TT>&quot; extension
	(configurable). These files are useful for comparing against the
	original source code using whatever you usually use to compare
	files, to easily find the changes Jester made that did not cause the
	tests to fail.</P>
	<LI><P>Jester prints out warnings when it can't find it's config
	files. In such circumstances, Jester uses default values which are
	OK in many cases (i.e. Java code with an &quot;ant&quot; build
	command).</P>
	<LI><P>Jester writes out a file &quot;<TT>jesterTimeout.txt</TT>&quot;
	(in the directory where it is executed) whose contents is the number
	of milliseconds the tests took to run the first time they were run
	(i.e. before Jester made any changes). This is used by Jester to
	stop running the tests if they are taking too long (e.g. in case a
	change made by Jester causes the code to enter an infinite loop). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If you kill Jester during a run, by CTRL-C, there is a risk
	that your source code will not be reverted back to its original
	state and hence the tests might fail and hence Jester will not be
	able to run against your code unless you revert the effected file.
	This might be fixed in a future version, but might not - Jester
	cannot be held responsible for messing up your source code, it's up
	to you to look after it. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Configuration options</H2>
<P>For the following features, edit the file called &quot;<TT>jester.cfg</TT>&quot;
from the installation directory and make sure it is on the classpath.
For example, <TT>buildPassString=BUILD SUCCESSFUL</TT> refers to a
line of text in the <TT>jester.cfg</TT> file. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Jester can be used for builds
	using any build tool that produces output to standard output that
	indicates whether the build was successful or not, by setting
	<TT>buildPassString</TT> to whatever indicates to Jester that the
	build was successful. By default, this is set to
	<TT>buildPassString=BUILD SUCCESSFUL</TT> which means that Jester
	will work with ant builds &quot;out of the box&quot;. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If your source code uses a
	different source file extension than <TT>.java</TT> then set
	<TT>sourceFileExtension</TT> as appropriate. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Jester can also be made to print the results as it goes
	rather than waiting until it has finished to print an amalgamated
	report of all the changes it has made per file, by setting
	<TT>shouldReportEagerly=true</TT>. This can be useful if Jester is
	failing to complete it's run. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Configurable mutations</H2>
<P>The mutations that Jester applies to the source code are
configurable, by editing the file &quot;<TT>mutations.cfg</TT>&quot;
from the installation directory, which must be on the classpath. Each
line of this file must have a format like: 
</P>
<P><TT>%if(%if(true ||</TT> where % can be any single character as a
delimiter, and the text <TT>if(</TT> will be replaced by <TT>if(true
||</TT>. 
</P>
<P>This simple scheme of replacing text without parsing has proven
adequate so far, but may change in a future version of Jester.</P>
<H2>Configurable Ignore List (e.g. for ignoring comments)</H2>
<P>Jester can be made to ignore parts of every source file, by using
the <TT>ignorelist.cfg</TT> file. This file contains lines starting
with a delimiter character that specify regions of the source code to
ignore; i.e. regions where it will not try to make a mutation. The
first string is where to start ignoring the source and the second is
where to stop ignoring the source. For example, to ignore comments in
Java code, the <TT>ignorelist.cfg</TT> file would contain: 
</P>
<PRE>%/*%*/
%//%\n</PRE><P>
This is not entirely correct but is close enough; e.g. a string
&quot;http://jester.sf.net&quot; up to the end of the line would not
be considered for mutation by Jester using this <TT>ignorelist.cfg</TT>
file, but that's not so bad. (Note - these are included in the
<TT>ignorelist.cfg</TT> file in the standard build). 
</P>
<P>This feature can be used by Pester (Jester on Python code) too,
e.g. to ignore python comments the <TT>ignorelist.cfg</TT> file would
contain:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">%#%\n</PRE><P>
Note - the standard build also includes the line
<TT>%//stopJesting%//resumeJesting</TT> so that you can easily tell
Jester to ignore parts if a source file if it is causing problems for
Jester. i.e. put a comment <TT>//stopJesting</TT> on the line before
the code you want Jester to ignore and <TT>//resumeJesting</TT> on
the line after the code you want Jester to ignore.</P>
<H2>Known Problems:</H2>
<P>If the code will not compile (either because of classes missing
from the class path before Jester tried to compile any classes, or as
a result of a change to a source file by Jester) then Jester might
hang indefinitely. 
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B> that this version of Jester <STRONG>will not</STRONG>
work with any version of Pester, but can be used <STRONG>instead</STRONG>
of Pester. This version of Jester is relatively easy to get to work
for any language as long as you can give Jester some command to run
(to compile if necessary, and run the tests of the code you want to
run Jester on) and the source file extension.</P>
<H2>For Jester Developers:</H2>
<P>If you want to look at Jester's java source code it is included in
your &quot;<TT>simple-jester.zip</TT>&quot; as a file called
&quot;<TT>source.jar</TT>&quot;. The source for the python code are
the <TT>.py</TT> files. To run Jester's tests</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>execute '<TT>runAllTests.bat</TT>', and the PyUnit and JUnit
	tests for Jester should run with no errors. (actually,
	makeAllChangesFilesTest.py currently fails - I haven't had a look
	why yet.) <B>Note that these tests need Python 2.2, JUnit 3.7/3.8.1
	and the <A HREF="http://www.mockobjects.com/">MockObjects</A>
	framework</B> - Jester itself will run with other versions of JUnit
	&gt;= 3.2 and doesn't need the <A HREF="http://www.mockobjects.com/">MockObjects</A>
	framework to run (Some test code was generated automatically using
	<A HREF="http://mockmaker.sourceforge.net/">MockMaker</A>). (BTW -
	the tests are not complete - see <A HREF="http://jester.sourceforge.net/">Jester
	web page</A> for details). The <A HREF="http://mockmaker.sourceforge.net/">MockMaker</A>
	modified <A HREF="http://www.mockobjects.com/">MockObjects</A>
	runtime is included as <TT>lib/mmmockobjects.jar</TT> under the
	relevant licenses (<A HREF="MockObjectsLicense.html">MockObjects
	license</A> and <A HREF="MockMakerLicense.html">MockMaker license</A>),
	hence: This product includes software developed by the Apache
	Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/). and the JUnit runtime
	is included as <TT>lib/junit.jar</TT> under it's <A HREF="JUNITLICENSE.htm">license</A>.

<H2>Support:</H2>
<P>Please check the <A HREF="http://jester.sourceforge.net/">Jester
web pages</A> (hosted by <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</A>)
for updates and the FAQs, and please enter comments or bug reports on
the appropriate pages linked from there.</P>
<H3>If it doesn't work</H3>
<P>The file &quot;<TT>jester.log</TT>&quot; (in the directory where
you ran jester) shows the commands that Jester has tried to run. In
many cases, you can work out what is wrong by trying to run the last
command that Jester tried to run. E.g. if the last line of the
&quot;<TT>jester.log</TT>&quot; says &quot;<TT>Sat Dec 01 21:46:36
PST 2001 Trying to run command &quot;ant.bat -f test-build.xml&quot;</TT>&quot;,
then try running &quot;<TT>ant.bat -f test-build.xml</TT>&quot;; this
may then reveal the problem. In the case of tests not passing (e.g.
the message &quot;Couldn't run test tester because tests didn't pass
before any changes made&quot;), try running the tests directly
(e.g. &quot;<TT>ant.bat -f test-build.xml</TT>&quot;). Please delete the
file &quot;<TT>jester.log</TT>&quot; whenever it gets too large, or
before running Jester if preferred.
